# üéØ Day10: Classes

## 1. [Creating your own classes](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/1/creating-your-own-classes)

### 1-1. Creating your own classes

- Classes are similar to structs in that they allow you to create new types with properties and methods, but they have 5 important differences
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ <u>**Classes never come with a memberwise initializer**</u>. This means if you have properties in your class, you must always create your own initializer.

```swift
class Dog {
    var name: String
    var breed: String

    init(name: String, breed: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    }
}
```

```swift
let poppy = Dog(name: "Poppy", breed: "Poodle")
```



### 1-2. Why does Swift have both classes and structs?

- Classes and structs have **five important differences**:

  - Classes do not come with synthesized memberwise initializers.
  - One class can be built upon (‚Äúinherit from‚Äù) another class, gaining its properties and methods.
  - Copies of structs are always unique, whereas copies of classes actually point to the same shared data.
  - Classes have deinitializers, which are methods that are called when an instance of the class is destroyed, but structs do not.
  - Variable properties in constant classes can be modified freely, but variable properties in constant structs cannot.

  **Most Swift developers prefer to use structs** rather than classes when possible, which means when you choose a class over a struct you‚Äôre doing so because you want one of the above behaviors.






## 2. [Class inheritance](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/2/class-inheritance)

### 2-1. Class inheritance

- You can create a class based on an existing class ‚Äì it inherits all the properties and methods of the original class, and can add its own on top.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **<u>Class inheritance / subclassing</u>**

```swift
class Dog {
    var name: String
    var breed: String

    init(name: String, breed: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    }
}
```

```swift
class Poodle: Dog {

}

let poppy = Poodle(name: "poo", breed: "dle")
// class Poodle
// super {name "poo", breed "dle"}
```

- With its own initializer

```swift
class Poodle: Dog {
    init(name: String) {
        super.init(name: name, breed: "Poodle")
    }
}

let poppy = Poodle(name: "poo")
// class Poodle
// super {name "poo", breed "Poodle"}
```



### 2-2. Why don‚Äôt Swift classes have a memberwise initializer?

- The main reason is that **classes have inheritance**, which would make memberwise initializers difficult to work with





## 3. [Overriding methods](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/3/overriding-methods)

### 3-1. Overriding methods

- Child classes can replace parent methods with their own implementations ‚Äì a process known as *overriding*.

```swift
class Dog {
    func makeNoise() {
        print("Woof!")
    }
}
```

```swift
class Poodle: Dog {
}

let poppy = Poodle()
poppy.makeNoise() // Woof!
```

- Method overriding allows us to change the implementation of `makeNoise()` for the `Poodle` class.

- `override func`

  ```swift
  class Poodle: Dog {
      override func makeNoise() {
          print("Yip!")
      }
  }
  
  let poppy = Poodle()
  poppy.makeNoise() // Yip!
  ```

  



### 3-2. When would you want to override a method?

- 






## 4. [Final classes](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/4/final-classes)

### 4-1. Final classes

- Although class inheritance is very useful, sometimes you want to disallow other developers from building their own class based on yours.

- `final`

  - when you declare a class as being final, **no other class can inherit** from it. This means they **can‚Äôt override** your methods in order to change your behavior ‚Äì they need to use your class the way it was written.
  
  ```swift
  final class Dog {
      var name: String
      var breed: String
  
      func makeNoise() {
          print("beforeeee")
      }
    
      init(name: String, breed: String) {
          self.name = name
          self.breed = breed
      }
  }
  ```
  
  ```swift
  // ERROR
  class Poodle: Dog { // Inheritance from a final class 'Dog'
      override func makeNoise() { // Instance method overrides a 'final' instance method
              print("overrrrr")
      }
  }
  ```
  
  

### 4-2. Which classes should be declared as final?

- Apple examples
  - `AVPlayerViewController`
  - `Timer`

- Author thinks many people instinctively declare their classes as final to mean ‚Äú**you shouldn‚Äôt subclass from this unless I specifically allow it**.‚Äù 





## 5. [Copying objects](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/5/copying-objects)

### 5-1. Copying objects

- When you copy a struct, both the original and the copy are different things ‚Äì changing one won‚Äôt change the other. 3Ô∏è‚É£ <u>**When you copy a *class*, both the original and the copy point to the *same* thing, so changing one *does* change the other.**</u> 

```swift
class Singer {
    var name = "Taylor Swift"
}
```

```swift
var singer = Singer()
print(singer.name)
```

- **Both `singer` and `singerCopy` point to the same object in memory**

```swift
var singerCopy = singer
singerCopy.name = "Justin Bieber"

print(singer.name) // JustinBieber
```



- When it's `struct`

  ```swift
  struct Singer {
      var name = "Taylor Swift"
  }
  
  var singer = Singer()
  var singerCopy = singer
  singerCopy.name = "Justin Bieber"
  
  print(singer.name) // Taylor Swift
  ```

  

### 5-2. Why do copies of a class share their data?

-  **`Class`: reference types**
   -  It‚Äôs like a **signpost** pointing to some data. If we create an instance of a class, it will take up some memory on your iPhone, and the variable that stores the instance is really just a signpost to the actual memory where the object lives. 
   -  If you **take a copy of the object, you get a new signpost** but it still points to the memory where the original object lives.

-  `struct`: value types



## 6. [Deinitializers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/6/deinitializers)

### 6-1. Deinitializers

- Ï¥àÍ∏∞Ìôî Ìï¥Ï†ú

- **<u>4Ô∏è‚É£ Classes can have *deinitializers*</u>** ‚Äì code that gets run when an instance of a class is destroyed.

```swift
class Person {
    var name = "John Doe"

    init() {
        print("\(name) is alive!")
    }

    func printGreeting() {
        print("Hello, I'm \(name)")
    }
}
```

```swift
for _ in 1...3 {
    let person = Person()
    person.printGreeting()
}

// John Doe is alive!
// Hello, I'm John Doe
// John Doe is alive!
// Hello, I'm John Doe
// John Doe is alive!
// Hello, I'm John Doe
```

- Deinitializer

```swift
class Person {
    var name = "John Doe"

    init() {
        print("\(name) is alive!")
    }

    func printGreeting() {
        print("Hello, I'm \(name)")
    }
    
  	// DEINITIALIZER
    deinit { 
        print("\(name) is no more")
    }
}
```

```swift
for _ in 1...3 {
    let person = Person()
    person.printGreeting()
}

// John Doe is alive!
// Hello, I'm John Doe
// John Doe is no more
// John Doe is alive!
// Hello, I'm John Doe
// John Doe is no more
// John Doe is alive!
// Hello, I'm John Doe
// John Doe is no more

```



### 6-2. Why do classes have deinitializers and structs don‚Äôt?





## 7. [Mutability](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/8/7/mutability)

### 7-1. Mutability

- If you have a constant struct with a variable property, that property can‚Äôt be changed because the struct itself is constant. However, **5Ô∏è‚É£ <u>if you have a constant *class* with a variable property, that property *can* be changed.**</u> 
- Because of this, classes don‚Äôt need the `mutating` keyword with methods that change properties; that‚Äôs only needed with structs.

```swift
class Singer {
    var name = "Taylor Swift" // var
}

let taylor = Singer()
taylor.name = "Ed Sheeran"
print(taylor.name) // Ed Sheeran
```

```swift
class Singer {
    let name = "Taylor Swift" // constant
}

let taylor = Singer()
taylor.name = "Ed Sheeran" // Cannot assign to property: 'name' is a 'let' constant
print(taylor.name)
```





### 7-2. Why can variable properties in constant classes be changed?
