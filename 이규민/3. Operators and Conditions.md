# üéØ Day3: Operators and Conditions

## 1. [Arithmetic Operators](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/1/arithmetic-operators)

### 1-1. Arithmetic Operators

- ÏÇ∞Ïà†Ïó∞ÏÇ∞

- `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`

### 1-2. Why can‚Äôt Swift add a Double to an Int?

- It isn‚Äôt safe to add a <u>`Double` to an `Int`</u> because **we lose any numbers after the decimal point**

  - `Int` only stores whole numbers whereas `Double` can store values after the decimal place.

- It isn‚Äôt safe to add an <u>`Int` to a `Double`</u> because **we lose some accuracy.**

  - The problem is that although `Double` uses the same amount of memory to store its value as `Int`, the *way* it stores its data is a little fuzzy ‚Äì it has really great precision with **smaller numbers**, but **increasingly fuzzy precision when you start working with large numbers**. 

  - In fact, there are certain numbers that `Double` isn‚Äôt even able to hold, so instead it stores a very slightly different value.

    ```swift
    let value: Double = 90000000000000001
    // Warning: '90000000000000001' is not exactly representable as 'Double'; it becomes '90000000000000000‚Äô.
    ```

  

### 1-3. Why does Swift have a dedicated division remainder operator?

- The remainder operator is really useful and comes up a lot. For example, many tables of data use ‚Äúzebra striping‚Äù ‚Äì they alternate the colors of rows to make them easier to read.

- `IsMultiple` does this number divide equally into some other number?

  ```swift
  let number = 465
  let isMultiple = number.isMultiple(of: 7)
  ```

  

## 2. [Operator overloading](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/2/operator-overloading)

### 2-1. Operator overloading

- Ïó∞ÏÇ∞Ïûê Ïò§Î≤ÑÎ°úÎî©

- Operator overloading is what an operator does depends on the values you use it with.



- integer

  ```swift
  let meaningOfLife = 42
  let doubleMeaning = 42 + 42
  ```

- strings

  ```swift
  let fakers = "Fakers gonna "
  let action = fakers + "fake"
  ```

- arrays

  ```swift
  let firstHalf = ["John", "Paul"]
  let secondHalf = ["George", "Ringo"]
  let beatles = firstHalf + secondHalf
  ```

  

### 2-2. Why does Swift need operator overloading?

- Operator overloading allows the same operator ‚Äì `+`, `*`, `/`, and so on ‚Äì to do different things depending on what data you use it with. 

- You can create your own **custom operators** if you want to, and even **modify Swift‚Äôs existing operators**.

  - custom operators

    ```swift
    infix operator .^.
    ```

    ```swift
    extension String {
        static func .^. (left: String, right: String) -> String { // <1>
            return String("\(left)üåà\(right)") // <2>
        }
    }
    ```

    ```swift
    "Hello".^."Swift"
    // HelloüåàSwift
    ```






## 3. [Compound assignment operators](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/3/compound-assignment-operators)

### 3-1. Compound assignment operators

- Î≥µÌï© Ìï†Îãπ Ïó∞ÏÇ∞Ïûê
- `-=`, `+=`

### 3-2. Why does Swift have compound assignment operators?

- They are just available as a *shorthand*: a simpler way to write the same thing. 
  - Less typing for us, less code to read, and also less chance of making mistakes



## 4. [Comparison operators](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/4/comparison-operators) 

### 4-1. Comparison operators

- ÎπÑÍµê Ïó∞ÏÇ∞Ïûê

- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`


### 4-2. How does Swift let us compare many types of data?

- `Date`

  - `someDate < someOtherDate`

- Enums

  ```swift
  enum Sizes: Comparable {
  	case small
    case medium
    case large
  }
  
  let first = Sizes.small
  let second = Sizes.medium
  print(first < second) // true
  // because small comes before large in the case enum list
  ```

  





## 5. [Conditions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/5/conditions)

### 5-1. Conditions

- Ï°∞Í±¥Ï†à

  - `if, else if, else`

  ```swift
  let firstCard = 11
  let secondCard = 10
  
  if firstCard + secondCard == 2 {
      print("Aces ‚Äì lucky!")
  } else if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
      print("Blackjack!")
  } else {
      print("Regular cards")
  }
  ```

  

### 5-2. What‚Äôs the difference between if and else if?

-  `else if` lets us combine the `else` with the `if`
- You can have as many `else if` checks as you want, but you need exactly one `if` and either zero or one `else`





## 6. [Combining conditions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/6/combining-conditions)

### 6-1. Combining conditions

- Î≥µÌï© Ï°∞Í±¥Ï†à
- `&&`, `||`

```swift
// &&
let age1 = 12
let age2 = 21

if age1 > 18 && age2 > 18 {
    print("Both are over 18")
}
```

```swift
// ||
if age1 > 18 || age2 > 18 {
    print("At least one is over 18")
}
```



### 6-2. How to check multiple conditions

- Ambiguous example

  ```swift
  if isOwner == true && isEditingEnabled || isAdmin == true {
      print("You can delete this post")
  }
  ```

- How swift interpretes the code

  ```swift
  if (isOwner == true && isEditingEnabled) || isAdmin == true {
      print("You can delete this post")
  }
  ```

- In order to avoid confusion, make sure to **insert parentheses**



## 7. [The ternary operator](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/7/the-ternary-operator)

### 7-1. The ternary operator

- ÏÇºÌï≠Ïó∞ÏÇ∞Ïûê

```swift
// the ternary operator
let firstCard = 11
let secondCard = 10
print(firstCard == secondCard ? "Cards are the same" : "Cards are different")
```

```swift
// regular condition
if firstCard == secondCard {
    print("Cards are the same")
} else {
    print("Cards are different")
}
```



### 7-2. When should you use the ternary operator in Swift?

- Some people rely very heavily on the ternary operator because it makes for **very short code**
- whereas some stay away from it as much as possible because it can make code **harder to read.**



 

## 8. [Switch statements](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/8/switch-statements)

### 8-1. Switch statements

- `switch case`

  - default is required

  ```swift
  let weather = "sunny"
  ```

  ```swift
  switch weather {
  case "rain":
      print("Bring an umbrella")
  case "snow":
      print("Wrap up warm")
  case "sunny":
      print("Wear sunscreen")
  default:
      print("Enjoy your day!")
  }
  ```

- `fallthrough`

  - Use `falltrhough` keyword if you want code execution to continue on to the next case
  - but it‚Äôs fairly **rare** to see it used in Swift 

  ```swift
  let weather = "sunny"
  
  switch weather {
  case "rain":
      print("Bring an umbrella")
  case "snow":
      print("Wrap up warm")
  case "sunny":
      print("Wear sunscreen") // "Wear sunscreen"
      fallthrough
  default:
      print("Enjoy your day!") // "Enjoy your day!"
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  let weather = "rain"
  
  switch weather {
  case "rain":
      print("Bring an umbrella")  // "Bring an umbrella"
       fallthrough
  case "snow":
      print("Wrap up warm") // "Warm up warm"
  case "sunny":
      print("Wear sunscreen")
  default:
      print("Enjoy your day!") 
  }
  ```

  

### 8-2. When should you use switch statements rather than if?

- That being said, there are **three reasons why** you might want to *consider* using `switch` rather than `if`:
  - Swift requires that its `switch` statements are exhaustive, which means you must either have a `case` block for every possible value to check (e.g. all cases of an enum) or you must have a `default` case. This isn‚Äôt true **for `if` and `else if`, so you might accidentally miss a case**.
  - When you use `switch` to **check a value for multiple possible results**, that value will only be read once, whereas if you use `if` it will be read multiple times. This becomes more important when you start using function calls, because some of these can be slow.
  - Swift‚Äôs `switch` cases allow for advanced pattern matching that is unwieldy with `if`.
  - If you want to check the same value for three or more possible states, you‚Äôll find folks prefer to use `switch` rather than `if` for legibility purposes if nothing else ‚Äì it becomes clearer that we‚Äôre checking the same value repeatedly, rather than writing different conditions.



 

## 9. [Range operators](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/3/9/range-operators)

### 9-1. Range operators

- `..<` ÎØ∏Îßå , `..>` Ï¥àÍ≥º, `...` Ïù¥Ìïò&Ïù¥ÏÉÅ

```swift
let score = 85

switch score {
case 0..<50:
    print("You failed badly.")
case 50..<85:
    print("You did OK.")
default:
    print("You did great!")
}
```



### 9-2. Why does Swift have two range operators?

- Ranges are great for counting through specific values, but they are also helpful for reading groups of items from arrays.

- To make the distinction easier when talking, Swift regularly uses very specific language: ‚Äú1 **to** 5‚Äù(`1..<5`) means 1, 2, 3, and 4, but ‚Äú1 **through** 5‚Äù (`1...5`) means 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

- One sided range

  ```swift
  let names = ["Piper", "Alex", "Suzanne", "Gloria"]
  print(name[1...]) // ["Alex", "Suzanne", "Gloria"]
  ```
