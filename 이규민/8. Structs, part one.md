# ðŸŽ¯ Day8: Structs, part one

## 1. [Creating your own structs](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/1/creating-your-own-structs)

### 1-1. Creating your own structs

```swift
struct Sport {
	var name: String
}
```

```swift
var tennis = Sport(name: "Tennis")
print(tennis.name)
```

we can change them just like regular variables:

```swift
tennis.name = "Lawn tennis"
print(tennis.name)
```



### 1-2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a struct and a tuple?

## 2. [Computed properties](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/2/computed-properties)

### 2-1. Computed properties

- A property that runs code **to figure out its value.**
  - `olympicStatus` looks like a regular `String`, but it returns **different values depending on the other properties**.

```swift
struct Sport {
    var name: String
    var isOlympicSport: Bool

    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympicSport {
            return "\(name) is an Olympic sport"
        } else {
            return "\(name) is not an Olympic sport"
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
let chessBoxing = Sport(name: "Chessboxing", isOlympicSport: false)
print(chessBoxing.olympicStatus)
```



### 2-2. When should you use a computed property or a stored property?

- 





## 3. [Property observers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/3/property-observers)

### 3-1. Property observers

- Property observers let you run code before or after any property changes. 
- `didSet`
  -  What we *want* to happen is for Swift to print a message **every time `amount` changes**, and we can use a **`didSet` property observer for that**. This will run some code every time `amount` changes:


```swift
struct Progress {
    var task: String
    var amount: Int {
        didSet {
            print("\(task) is now \(amount)% complete")
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
var progress = Progress(task: "Loading data", amount: 0)
progress.amount = 30
progress.amount = 80
progress.amount = 100
```

- `willSet`
  - to take action *before* a property changes, but that is rarely used.



### 3-2. When should you use property observers?

- 

### 3-3. When should you use willSet rather than didSet?

### 5-1. Mutating methods



### 5-2. Why do we need to mark some methods as mutating?
