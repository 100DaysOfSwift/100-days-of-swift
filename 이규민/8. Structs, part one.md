# ðŸŽ¯ Day8: Structs, part one

## 1. [Creating your own structs](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/1/creating-your-own-structs)

### 1-1. Creating your own structs

```swift
struct Sport {
	var name: String
}
```

```swift
var tennis = Sport(name: "Tennis")
print(tennis.name)
```

we can change them just like regular variables:

```swift
tennis.name = "Lawn tennis"
print(tennis.name)
```

## 2. [Computed properties](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/2/computed-properties)

### 2-1. Computed properties

- A property that runs code **to figure out its value.**
  - `olympicStatus` looks like a regular `String`, but it returns **different values depending on the other properties**.

```swift
struct Sport {
    var name: String
    var isOlympicSport: Bool

    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympicSport {
            return "\(name) is an Olympic sport"
        } else {
            return "\(name) is not an Olympic sport"
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
let chessBoxing = Sport(name: "Chessboxing", isOlympicSport: false)
print(chessBoxing.olympicStatus)
```



### 2-2. When should you use a computed property or a stored property?

- 





## 3. [Property observers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/3/property-observers)

### 3-1. Property observers

- Property observers let you run code before or after any property changes. 
- `didSet`
  -  What we *want* to happen is for Swift to print a message **every time `amount` changes**, and we can use a **`didSet` property observer for that**. This will run some code every time `amount` changes:


```swift
struct Progress {
    var task: String
    var amount: Int {
        didSet {
            print("\(task) is now \(amount)% complete")
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
var progress = Progress(task: "Loading data", amount: 0)
progress.amount = 30
progress.amount = 80
progress.amount = 100
```

- `willSet`
  - to take action *before* a property changes, but that is rarely used.



### 3-2. When should you use property observers?

- 

### 3-3. When should you use willSet rather than didSet?






## 4. [Methods](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/4/methods)

### 4-1. Methods

- Structs can have functions inside them, and those functions can use the properties of the struct as they need to. 
  - **Functions inside structs** are called *methods*, but they still use the same `func` keyword.

```swift
struct City {
    var population: Int
    
    func collectTaxes() -> Int {
        return population * 1000
    }
}
```

```swift
let london = City(population: 9_000_000)
london.collectTaxes()
```



### 4-2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a function and a method?

- 





## 5. [Mutating methods](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/5/mutating-methods)

### 5-1. Mutating methods

- Swift wonâ€™t let you write methods that change properties unless you specifically request it.
  - When you ***want* to change a property inside a method**, you need to mark it using the **`mutating`** keyword, like this:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String

    mutating func makeAnonymous() {
        name = "Anonymous"
    }
}
```

```swift
var person = Person(name: "Ed")
print(person) // Person(name: "Ed")
person.makeAnonymous() // Person(name: "Anonymous")
```



### 5-2. Why do we need to mark some methods as mutating?

-  



## 6. [Properties and methods of strings](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/6/properties-and-methods-of-strings)

### 6-1. Properties and methods of strings

```swift
let string = "Do or do not, there is no try."
```

- `count`

  ```swift
  print(string.count) // 30
  ```

- `hasPrefix()`

  ```swift
  print(string.hasPrefix("Do")) // True
  ```

- `uppercased()`

  ```swift
  print(string.uppercased())
  // DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY.
  ```

- `sorted()`

  ```swift
  print(string.sorted())
  // [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", ",", ".", "D", "d", "e", "e", "h", "i", "n", "n", "o", "o", "o", "o", "o", "r", "r", "r", "s", "t", "t", "t", "y"]
  ```

  





### 6-2. Why are strings structs in Swift?



## 7. [Properties and methods of arrays](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/7/properties-and-methods-of-arrays)

### 7-1. Properties and methods of arrays

```swift
var toys = ["Woody"]
```

- `count`

  ```swift
  print(toys.count) // 1
  ```

- `append()`

  ```swift
  toys.append("Buzz") // ["Woody", "Buzz"]
  ```

- `firstIndex()`

  ```swift
  toys.firstIndex(of: "Buzz") // 1
  ```

- `sorted()`

  ```swift
  print(toys.sorted()) // ["Buzz", "woody"]
  ```

- `remove()`

  ```swift
  toys.remove(at: 0) // "Woody"
  ```

  

### 7-2. Why do strings behave differently from arrays in Swift?
