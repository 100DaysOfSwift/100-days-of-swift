# üéØ Day2: Complex Data Types

## 1. [Arrays](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/1/arrays)

### 1-1. Arrays

- Collections of values that are stored as a single value

```swift
let john = "John Lennon"
let paul = "Paul McCartney"
let george = "George Harrison"
let ringo = "Ringo Starr"

let beatles = [john, paul, george, ringo] // Array
beatles[1] // "Paul McCartney"
```

- Type annotations - arrays are written in brackets

  - `[String]`, `[Int]`, `[Double]`, `[Bool]`

  

### 1-2. Why does Swift have arrays?

- Swift‚Äôs strings, integers, Booleans, and Doubles allow us to temporarily store single values, but if you want to store **many values** you will often use *arrays* instead.
- In other words, **arrays hold many values inside them**
- We read values out of arrays using their numerical position, **counting from 0**



## 2. [Sets](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/2/sets)

### 2-1. Sets

- Items aren‚Äôt stored in any order; they are stored in what is effectively a **random order**.
- No item can appear twice in a set; **all items must be unique**.

```swift
let colors = Set(["red", "green", "blue"]) // {"blue", "red", "green"}
let colors2 = Set(["red", "green", "blue", "red", "green"]) // {"blue", "green", "red"}
```



### 2-2. Why are sets different from arrays in Swift?

- *how* they hold their values is what matter
  - **sets** 
    - unordered 
    - *cannot* contain duplicates
    - fast retrieval
  - **arrays** 
    - retain their order 
    - *can* contain duplicates

## 3. [Tuples](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/3/tuples)

### 3-1. Tuples

- You **can‚Äôt add or remove items** from a tuple; **they are fixed in size**.
- You **can‚Äôt change the type** of items in a tuple
- You can access items in a tuple using **numerical positions** or by **naming them,** but Swift won‚Äôt let you read numbers or names that don‚Äôt exist.

```swift
var name = (first: "Taylor", last: "Swift") // (first: "Taylor", last: "Lautner")
name.0 																			// "Taylor"
name.first						 											// "Taylor"
name.1 = "Lautner" 													// "Lautner"
print(name) 																// (first: "Taylor", last: "Lautner")
	
name.last = 1 // Cannot assign value of type 'int' to type 'String'
```



### 3-2. How are tuples different from arrays in Swift?

-  tuples hold a ***fixed set*** of things that **can‚Äôt be changed**, whereas variable arrays can have items added to them indefinitely.

  ```swift
  // Tuple
  var website = (name: "Apple", url: "www.apple.com")
  ```

  ```swift
  // Array
  var website = ["Apple", "www.apple.com"]
  ```

- Another advantage to tuples is that **each value is specifically created by you**, so as well as providing a **name** you also provide a ***type***.

  ```swift
  // Tuple
  var person = (name: "Paul", age: 40, isMarried: true)
  ```

- **Dictionaries** provide an interesting third case, because they give us **some of the name safety** of tuples but can grow and change like arrays. 
  - I say ‚Äúsome of the name safety‚Äù because we can‚Äôt guarantee that a particular value exists in a dictionary like we can with a tuple



## 4. [Arrays vs sets vs tuples](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/4/arrays-vs-sets-vs-tuples)

### 4-1. Arrays vs sets vs tuples

- If you need a specific, fixed collection of **related values** where each item has a precise position or name, you should use a **<u>TUPLE</u>**:

  ```swift
  let address = (house: 555, street: "Taylor Swift Avenue", city: "Nashville")
  ```

- If you need a collection of values that must be **unique** or you need to be able to check whether a specific item is in there **extremely quickly**, you should use a **<u>SET</u>**:

  ```swift
  let set = Set(["aardvark", "astronaut", "azalea"])
  ```

- If you need a collection of values that can contain **duplicates**, or the **order of your items matters**, you should use an **<u>ARRAY</u>**:

  ```swift
  let pythons = ["Eric", "Graham", "John", "Michael", "Terry", "Terry"]
  ```



### 4-2. When should you use an array, a set, or a tuple in Swift?

- **SET**
  - If you want to store a list of *all words in a dictionary for a game*, that has <u>no duplicates</u> and the <u>order doesn‚Äôt matter</u> so you would go for a **set**.
  - If you want to store all the *articles read by a user*, you would use a set if <u>the order didn‚Äôt matter</u> (if all you cared about was whether they had read it or not)

- **ARRAY**
  - If you want to store all the *articles read by a user*, you would use an **array** if <u>the order *did* matter.</u>
  - If you want to store items for a *todo list*, that works best when the <u>order is predictable</u> so you should use an **array**.
  -  you want to store a *list of high scores* for a video game, that has an <u>order that matters</u> and <u>might contain duplicates</u> (if two players get the same score), so you‚Äôd use an **array**.

- **TUPLE**
  - If you want to hold <u>precisely</u> two strings, or precisely two strings and an integer, or precisely three Booleans, or similar, you should use a **tuple**.






## 5. [Dictionaries](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/5/dictionaries)

### 5-1. Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are collections of values just like arrays, but rather than storing things with an integer position you can access them using anything you want.

```swift
let heights = [
    "Taylor Swift": 1.78, // key: value
    "Ed Sheeran": 1.73
]

heights["Taylor Swift"] // 1.78
```

- Type annotations of dictionary - written in **brackets with a colon** between your identifier and value types
  - `[String: Double]`, `[String: String]`



### 5-2. Why does Swift have dictionaries as well as arrays?

- Dictionaries let us choose a **‚Äúkey‚Äù** that identifies the item we want to add, whereas arrays just add each item sequentially.
- Dictionaries don‚Äôt store our items using an index, but instead they optimize the way they store items for **fast retrieval**.
- You can‚Äôt be guaranteed that a key in a dictionary exists.





## 6. [Dictionary default values](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/6/dictionary-default-values)

### 6-1. Dictinary default values

- If you try to read a value from a dictionary using a key that doesn‚Äôt exist, Swift will send you back `nil` ‚Äì nothing at all. 
- alternative: we can provide the dictionary with a **default value** to use **if we request a missing key.**

```swift
let favoriteIceCream = [
    "Paul": "Chocolate",
    "Sophie": "Vanilla"
]

favoriteIceCream["Paul"] // "Chocolate"
favoriteIceCream["Charlotte"] // nil
favoriteIceCream["Charlotte", default: "Unknown"] // "Unknown"
```



### 6-2. Why does Swift have default values for dictionaries?

- Having no value can cause problems in your code, not least because you need to add extra functionality to handle missing values safely

  - dictionary default values let you provide **a backup value** to use for when the key you ask for doesn‚Äôt exist.

  ```swift
  let results = [
      "english": 100,
      "french": 85,
      "geography": 75
  ]
  ```

  If we wanted to read their **`history` score**, how we do it depends on what we want:

  1. If a missing value means the **student failed to take the test**, then we could use a default value of `0` so that we always get an integer back.

     ```swift
     let historyResult = results["history", default: 0]
     ```

  2. If a missing value means the **student has yet to take the exam**, then we should skip the default value and instead look for a `nil` value.



## 7. [Creating empty collections](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/7/creating-empty-collections)

### 7-1. Creating empty collections

- Arrays, sets, and dictionaries are called ***collections***

- If you want to create an *empty* collection just write **its type followed by opening and closing parentheses**. 

  - empty dictionary

    ```swift
    var teams = [String: String]()
    teams["Paul"] = "Red" // ["Paul": "Red"]
    
    var newTeams = Dictionary<String, Int>()
    newTeams["Taylor"] = 2 // ["Taylor": 2]
    ```

  - empty array

    ```swift
    var results = [Int]()
    
    var results = Array<Int>()
    ```

  - empty set

    ```swift
    var words = Set<String>()
    var numbers = Set<Int>()
    ```



### 7-2. Why would you want to create an empty collection?

- When you *don‚Äôt* know all your data up front





## 8. [Enumerations](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/8/enumerations)

### 8-1. Enumerations

- (ÏõêÏãúÍ∞íÏù¥ ÏóÜÎäî) Ïó¥Í±∞Ìòï

- usually called just `enums` ‚Äì are a way of defining **groups of related values** in a way that makes them easier to use.

```swift
enum Result {
  case success
  case failure
}

enum Result {
  case success, failure
}

let result4 = Result.failure // failure
```



### 8-2. Why does Swift need enums?

- Enum is simply a nice name for a value. So, enums are a way of us saying **something specific and safe**. 
- Behind the scenes, Swift can store its enum values very simply, so they are **much faster** to **create** and **store** than something like a string.





## 9. [Enum associated values](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/9/enum-associated-values)

### 9-1. Enum associated values

- enums can also store ***associated* values** attached to each case. This lets you attach additional information to your enums so they can represent more nuanced data.

```swift
enum Activity {
    case bored
    case running(destination: String)
    case talking(topic: String)
    case singing(volume: Int)
}

let talking = Activity.talking(topic: "football") // talking(topic "football")
```



### 9-2. Why would you want to associate a value with an enum case?

- Enums with associated values let us add **extra information** to an enum case ‚Äì think of them as being **adjectives** to a noun, because it lets us **describe the thing in more detail**.

- Compare two cases below:

  ```swift
  // Enums with associated values
  enum Weather {
      case sunny
      case windy(speed: Int)
      case rainy(chance: Int, amount: Int)
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  // Enums w/o associated values
  enum Weather {
      case sunny
      case lightBreeze
      case aBitWindy
      case quiteBlusteryNow
      case nowThatsAStrongWind
      case thisIsSeriousNow
      case itsAHurricane
  }
  ```

  



## 10. [Enum raw values](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/10/enum-raw-values)

### 10-1. Enum raw values

- ÏõêÏãúÍ∞íÏù¥ ÏûàÎäî Ïó¥Í±∞Ìòï

- Sometimes you need to be able to assign values to enums so they have meaning. This lets you create them **dynamically**, and also use them in different ways.

```swift
// Int
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury
    case venus
    case earth
    case mars
}
```

- Swift will automatically assign each of those **a number starting from 0**, and you can use that number to create an instance of the appropriate enum case. 

  ```swift
  let second = Planet(rawValue: 2) // earth
  ```

- You can assign one or more cases **a specific value**, and Swift will generate the rest

```swift
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury = 1
    case venus
    case earth
    case mars
}

let second = Planet(rawValue:2) // venus
```

- more cases (ref: [Swift) Ïó¥Í±∞Ìòï(Enumeration) Í∏∞Ï¥àÌé∏](https://babbab2.tistory.com/116))

```swift
enum Planet: String {
  case mercury				 // rawValue: mercury
  case venus  = "Í∏àÏÑ±"	// rawValue: "Í∏àÏÑ±"
  case earth = "ÏßÄÍµ¨"		// rawValue: "ÏßÄÍµ¨"
  case mars = "ÌôîÏÑ±"		// rawValue: "ÌôîÏÑ±"
}
```

```swift
enum Planet: Character {
  case mercury = "m" // rawValue: m
  case venus				 // ERROR: Enum case must declare a raw value 
  case earth = "e"	 // rawValue: e
}
```

```swift
enum Position: Double {
  case east = 1.0		// rawValue: 1.0
  case west = 2.0		// rawValue: 2.0
  case south = 3.0	// rawValue: 3.0
  case north 				// ERROR: Enum case must declare a raw value 
}
```

```swift
enum Position: Double {
  case east = 1.0		// rawValue: 1.0
  case west = 2.0		// rawValue: 2.0
  case south = 3		// rawValue: 3.0
  case north 				// rawValue: 4.0
}
```



### 10-2. Why do Swift's enums have raw values?

- If we need to download a list of users from the internet and know what their current mood is, then that server needs to be able to send that data in a way we can understand.
- `Enum raw values` let us use enums just like we normally would, but **also attach an underlying value to each case**. Inside our Swift code this mostly won‚Äôt have any effect, but it does mean we now have a specific, fixed way of referring to each value for the **times we need it**. So we can also download some data from a server, and be told ‚Äúthis user has `enum` 0,‚Äù
