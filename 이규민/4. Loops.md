# 🎯 Day4: Loops

## 1. [For loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/1/for-loops)

### 1-1. For loops

- `for ... in`

```swift
let count = 1...10

for number in count {
    print("Number is \(number)")
}
```

```swift
let albums = ["Red", "1989", "Reputation"]

for album in albums {
    print("\(album) is on Apple Music")
}
```

- Using `_`

```swift
print("Players gonna ")

for _ in 1...5 {
    print("play")
}
```



### 1-2. Why does Swift use underscores with loops?

- Sometimes **you don’t actually need the value that is currently being read**, which is where the underscore comes in: Swift will recognize you don’t actually need the variable, and **won’t make the temporary constant** for you.

- Swift can do the same job without the underscore. However, using an underscore does something very similar for our brain: we can **look at the code and immediately see** the loop variable isn’t being used, no matter how many lines of code are inside the loop body.





## 2. [While loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/2/while-loops)

### 2-1. While loops

```swift
var number = 1

while number <= 20 {
    print(number)
    number += 1
}

print("Ready or not, here I come!")
```



### 2-2. When should you use a while loop?

- we can keep the loop going around until we’re ready to exit.
- The main difference is that `for` loops are generally **used with finite sequences**: we loop through the numbers 1 through 10, or through the items in an array, for example. 
- On the other hand, `while` loops can loop until any arbitrary condition becomes false, which allows them u**ntil we tell them to stop**.
  - This means we can repeat the same code until…
    - …the user asks us to stop
    - …a server tell us to stop
    - …we’ve found the answer we’re looking for
    - …we’ve generated enough data







## 3. [Repeat loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/3/repeat-loops)

### 3-1. Repeat loops

- it’s identical to a `while` loop **except the condition to check comes at the end**.

```swift
var number = 1

repeat {
    print(number)
    number += 1
} while number <= 20

print("Ready or not, here I come!")
```

- The code inside the loop will always be executed at least once
  - Because the condition comes at the *end* of the `repeat` loop
  - whereas `while` loops check their condition before their first run.



### 3-2. When should you use a repeat loop?

- If we always want code to run at least once, why not just put it before the loop body as well as inside the loop body?
- The answer is partly something programmers call “DRY”: **Don’t Repeat Yourself**. We usually prefer to write code once and only once, and consider repeated code to be a sign that something has gone wrong. 
  - Some folks take this to an extreme and repeat nothing and that’s usually a bad idea, but here we can definitely avoid repeating ourself with a `repeat` loop.


```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var random = numbers.shuffled()

while random == numbers {
    random = numbers.shuffled()
}
```

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var random: [Int]

repeat {
    random = numbers.shuffled()
} while random == numbers
```





## 4. [Exiting loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/4/exiting-loops)

### 4-1. Exiting loops

- `break`




### 4-2. Why would you want to exit a loop?

- For example, if you want to figure out how many of them the player achieved without getting a 0, you might write this:

  ```swift
  let scores = [1, 8, 4, 3, 0, 5, 2]
  var count = 0
  
  for score in scores {
      if score == 0 {
          break
      }
  
      count += 1
  }
  
  print("You had \(count) scores before you got 0.")
  ```

  Without `break` we’d need to continue looping through scores even after we found the first 0, which is wasteful.






## 5. [Exiting multiple loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/5/exiting-multiple-loops)

### 5-1. Exiting multiple loops

- Regular nested loop

  ```swift
  for i in 1...10 {
      for j in 1...10 {
          let product = i * j
          print("\(i) * \(j) is \(product)")
      }
  }
  ```

- Exit part-way 

  ```swift
  outerLoop: for i in 1...10 {
    for j in 1...10 {
      let product = i * j
      print("\(i) * \(j) is \(product)")
      
      if product == 50 {
  			print("It's a bull's eye!")
        break outerLoop
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- With a regular `break`, only the inner loop would be exited – the outer loop would continue where it left off.



### 5-2. Why does Swift have labeled statements?

-  Swift’s labeled statements allow us to name certain parts of our code, and it’s **most commonly used for breaking out of nested loops**.





## 6. [Skipping items](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/6/skipping-items)

### 6-1. Skipping items

- `continue`
- If you just want to **skip the current item** and continue on to the next one, you should use `continue` instead.



### 6-2. When to use break and when to use continue

- When we use `continue` we’re saying “I’m done with **the current run of this loop**” 
  - Swift will skip the rest of the loop body, and go to the next item in the loop. 
  
- But when we say `break` we’re saying “I’m done with **this loop altogether, so get out completely**.” 
  - Swift will skip the remainder of the body loop, but also skip any other loop items that were still to come.






## 7. [Infinite loops](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/4/7/infinite-loops)

### 7-1. Infinite loops

- All apps on your iPhone use infinite loops, because they start running, then continually watch for events **until you choose to quit** them.
- `while true`



### 7-2. Why would you want to make an infinite loop?

- All the apps you use on your iPhone have infinite loops. 
- Think about it: when your app launches it needs to repeat a series of instructions until it’s told to stop:
  1. Check for any user input
  2. Run any code you need
  3. Redraw the screen
  4. Repeat
- That might last for 10 seconds if you’re just checking Twitter, but it might last for hours if you’re playing a game – or perhaps it might run for much longer. The point is that **we don’t know when the loop will stop**, so we can just loop from 1 to a billion.
