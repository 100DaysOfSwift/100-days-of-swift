# 🎯 Day7: Closures, part two

## 1. [Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/6/using-closures-as-parameters-when-they-accept-parameters)

### 1-1. Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters

```swift
// if they don't accept parameters 
// action: () -> Void
func travel(action: (String) -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action("London")
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

```swift
// trailing closure syntax
travel { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
```



### 1-2. When would closures with parameters be used as parameters?

## 2. [Using closures as parameters when they return values](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/7/using-closures-as-parameters-when-they-return-values)

### 2-1. Using closures as parameters when they return values

```swift
func travel(action: (String) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London")
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

```swift
travel { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```



### 2-2. When would you use closures with return values as parameters to a function?

- 





## 3. [Shorthand parameter names](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/8/shorthand-parameter-names)

### 3-1. Shorthand parameter names

- Original

```swift
func travel(action: (String) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London")
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

```swift
travel { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```

- remove data type

```swift
travel { place in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```

- remove `return` cause the closure only has one line of code

```swift
travel { place in
    "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```

- **Shorthand syntax**

  - Rather than writing `place in` we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closure’s parameters. These are named with a **dollar sign**, then **a number counting from 0**.

  ```swift
  travel {
      "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
  }
  ```



### 3-2. When should you use shorthand parameter names?

- “it depends”
  - Are there many parameters? If so, shorthand syntax stops being useful and in fact starts being counterproductive – was it `$3` or `$4` that you need to compare against `$0` Give them actual names and their meaning becomes clearer.
  
  - Is the function commonly used? As your Swift skills progress, you’ll start to realize that there are a handful – maybe 10 or so – extremely common functions that use closures, so others reading your code will easily understand what `$0` means.
  - Are the shorthand names used several times in your method? If you need to refer to `$0` more than maybe two or three times, you should probably just give it a real name.
  
- What matters is that your code is **easy to read** and **easy to understand.** 




## 4. [Closures with multiple parameters](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/9/closures-with-multiple-parameters)

### 4-1. Closures with multiple parameters

```swift
func travel(action: (String, Int) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London", 60)
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

```swift
travel { (place: String, mile: Int) in
    return "I'm going to \(place) at \(mile) miles per hour"
}
```

```swift
// Shorthand syntax
travel {
    "I'm going to \($0) at \($1) miles per hour."
}
```



### 4-2. How many parameters can a closure take?

- **In theory** a closure can take **as many parameters as you like**, 
- In practice the overwhelming majority of examples you’ll see **take zero to three parameters**. 





## 5. [Returning closures from functions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/10/returning-closures-from-functions)

### 5-1. Returning closures from functions

```swift
// travel function returns closure accepts string, then the closure returns void 
func travel() -> (String) -> Void {
    return {
        print("I'm going to \($0)")
    }
}
```

```swift
let result = travel()
result("London")
```

## 6. [Capturing values](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/11/capturing-values)

### 6-1. Capturing values

```swift
func travel() -> (String) -> Void {
    return {
        print("I'm going to \($0)")
    }
}

let result = travel()
result("London")
```

- If you use any external values inside your closure, Swift *captures* them – **stores them alongside the closure**, so they can be modified even if they don’t exist any more.
- Closure capturing happens if we create values in `travel()` that get used inside the closure. 

```swift
func travel() -> (String) -> Void {
    var counter = 1

    return {
        print("\(counter). I'm going to \($0)")
        counter += 1
    }
}
```

```swift
let result = travel()
result("London") // 1. I'm going to London
result("London") // 2. I'm going to London
result("London") // 3. I'm going to London
result("London") // 4. I'm going to London
```



### 6-2. Why do Swift’s closures capture values?
