# 🎯 Day5: Functions

## 1. [Writing functions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/1/writing-functions)

### 1-1. Writing functions

- Functions help us to achieve DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)

  - They are designed to let us re-use code easily.

- example

  ```swift
  func printHelp() {
      let message = """
  Welcome to MyApp!
  
  Run this app inside a directory of images and
  MyApp will resize them all into thumbnails
  """
  
      print(message)
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  printHelp()
  ```

  

### 1-2. What code should be put in a function?

- There are three times you’ll want to create your own functions:
  1. When you want the **same functionality in many places**. Using a function here means you can change one piece of code and have everywhere that uses your function get updated.
  2. Functions are also useful for **breaking up code**. If you have one long function it can be hard to follow everything that’s going on, but if you break it up into three or four smaller functions then it becomes easier to follow.
  3. Swift lets us build new functions out of existing functions, which is a technique called ***function composition(합성함수/함수 컴포지션)***. By splitting your work into multiple small functions, function composition lets us build big functions by combining those small functions in various ways, a bit like Lego bricks.






## 2. [Accepting parameters](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/2/accepting-parameters)

### 2-1. Accepting paratmeters

- Parameters

  - Values sent into functions

    ```swift
    print("Hello, world!")
    ```

- example

  ```swift
  func square(number: Int) {
      print(number * number)
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  square(number: 8)
  ```



### 2-2. How many parameters should a function accept?

- A function could take no parameters or take 20 of them
- But when a function takes many parameters – perhaps six or more, but this is extremely subjective – you need to start asking whether that **function is perhaps doing a bit too much work**.





## 3. [Returning values](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/3/returning-values)

### 3-1. Returning values

- Functions can also send back data

  - `->` + `[datatype]`

  ```swift
  func square(number: Int) -> Int {
      return number * number
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  let result = square(number: 8)
  print(result)
  ```



### 3-2. When is the return keyword not needed in a Swift function?

- 

### 3-3. How can you return two or more values from a function?

- Using a **tuple**, such as `(name: String, age: Int)`
- Using some sort of collection, such as an **array** or a **dictionary**.

- Using a tuple is most ideal 

  ```swift
  func getUser() -> (first: String, last: String) {
      (first: "Taylor", last: "Swift")
  }
  
  let user = getUser()
  print(user.first)
  ```

  





## 4. [Parameter labels](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/4/parameter-labels)

### 4-1. Parameter labels

- Swift lets us provide two names for each parameter: one to be used externally when calling the function, one to be used internally inside the function

  ```swift
  func sayHello(to name: String) {
      print("Hello, \(name)!") // "Hello, Taylor!"
  }
  
  sayHello(to: "Taylor")
  ```

  


### 4-2. Why does Swift use parameter label?

- 







## 5. [Omitting parameter labels](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/5/omitting-parameter-labels)

### 5-1. Omitting parameter labels

-  Use `_`(underscore) for the external parameter name

  ```swift
  func greet(_ person: String) {
      print("Hello, \(person)!")
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  greet("Taylor")
  ```

- This can make some code more natural to read, but generally it’s better to give your parameters external names to avoid confusion. 



### 5-2. When should you omit a parameter label?

-  When your **function name is a verb** and **the first parameter is a noun** the verb is acting on. For example:
   - Greeting a person would be `greet(taylor)` rather than `greet(person: taylor)`
   - Buying a product would be `buy(toothbrush)` rather than `buy(item: toothbrush)`
   - Finding a customer would be `find(customer)` rather than `find(user: customer)`



## 6. [Default parameters](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/6/default-parameters)

### 6-1. Default parameters

- `print()`

  ```swift
  func print(
      _ items: Any...,
      separator: String = " ",
      terminator: String = "\n"  // default
  )
  ```
- Example

  ```swift
  func greet(_ person: String, nicely: Bool = true) {
      if nicely == true {
          print("Hello, \(person)!")
      } else {
          print("Oh no, it's \(person) again...")
      }
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  greet("Taylor") // "Hello, Taylor!"
  // Default: Bool = true
  
  greet("Taylor", nicely: false)// "Oh no, it's Taylor again..."
  ```

  

### 6-2. When to use default parameters for functions

- Shorter, simpler code most of the time, but flexibility when we need it – perfect.
  
- example
  
  ```swift
  func findDirections(from: String, to: String, route: String = "fastest", avoidHighways: Bool = false) {
      // code here
  }
  ```
  
  ```swift
  findDirections(from: "London", to: "Glasgow")
  findDirections(from: "London", to: "Glasgow", route: "scenic")
  findDirections(from: "London", to: "Glasgow", route: "scenic", avoidHighways: true)
  ```
  
  
  






## 7. [Variadic functions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/7/variadic-functions)

### 7-1. Variadic functions

- 가변인자함수

- They accept any number of parameters of the same type

  - `print`

    ```swift
    print("Haters", "gonna", "hate") // "Haters gonna hate"
    ```

  - `...`: zero or more integers

    ```swift
    func square(numbers: Int...) {
        for number in numbers {
            print("\(number) squared is \(number * number)")
        }
    }
    
    square(numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    // 1 squared is 1
    // 2 squared is 4
    // 3 squared is 9
    // 4 squared is 16
    // 5 squared is 25
    ```

    


### 7-2. When to use variadic functions

- As for *when* you should use them, chances are you won’t use them that much while you’re learning because you’re going to be focused on very specific problems that are usually fairly small. 
- But as your skills increase, you’ll find that you can change your existing functions to make them variadic without breaking any of your code – **you can add functionality without changing what you already have**.





## 8. [Writing throwing functions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/8/writing-throwing-functions)

### 8-1. Writing throwing functions

- `throw`

- example

  - First we need to define an `enum` that describes the errors we can throw. These must always be based on Swift’s existing `Error` type.

  ```swift
  enum PasswordError: Error {
      case obvious
  }
  ```

  - `throws` & `throw`

  ```swift
  func checkPassword(_ password: String) throws -> Bool {
      if password == "password" {
          throw PasswordError.obvious
      }
      return true
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  // THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T USE `DO`, `TRY`, `CATCH`
  
  checkPassword("password") 
  // Playground execution terminated: An error was thrown and was not caught:
  // __lldb_expr_210.PasswordError.obvious
  
  checkPassword("legit password") // true
  ```

  

### 8-2. When should you write throwing functions?

- When you’re just getting started, **I would recommend you avoid throwing functions** most of the time. They can feel a bit clumsy at first because you need to make sure all the errors are handled wherever you use the function, so it feels almost a bit “infectious” – suddenly you have errors needing to be handled in several places in your code, and if those errors bubble up further then the “infection” just spreads.
- So, when you’re learning start small: **keep the number of throwing functions low**, and work outwards from there. Over time you’ll get a get better grip on managing errors to keep your program flow smooth, and you’ll feel more confident about adding throwing functions.





## 9. [Running throwing functions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/9/running-throwing-functions)

### 9-1. Running throwing functions

- Swift won’t let you run an error-throwing function by accident. 
- Instead, you need to call these functions using three new keywords: `do`, `try`, `catch` 

```swift
func checkPassword(_ password: String) throws -> Bool {
    if password == "password" {
        throw PasswordError.obvious
    }
    return true
}
```

```swift
do {
    try checkPassword("password")
    print("That password is good!")
} catch {
    print("You can't use that password.") // "You can't use that password."
}
```



### 9-2. Why does Swift make us use try before every throwing function?

- By forcing us to use `try` before every throwing function, we’re explicitly acknowledging **which parts of our code can cause errors**. 

- This is particularly useful if you have several throwing functions in a single `do` block, like this:

  ```swift
  do {
      try throwingFunction1() // can throw errors
      nonThrowingFunction1() // CANNOT throw errors
      try throwingFunction2() // can throw errors
      nonThrowingFunction2() // CANNOT throw errors
      try throwingFunction3() // can throw errors
  } catch {
      // handle errors
  }
  ```

  



## 10. [inout parameters](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/5/10/inout-parameters)

### 10-1. inout parameters

- All parameters passed into a Swift function are *constants*, so you can’t change them.

- But if you want, you can pass in one or more parameters **as  `inout`, which means they <u>can be changed</u> inside your function, and those changes reflect in the original value outside the function.**

  - For example, if you want to double a number in place – i.e., change the value directly rather than returning a new one – you might write a function like this:

    ```swift
    func doubleInPlace(number: inout Int) {
      number *= 2
    }
    ```

- You also need to pass the parameter to `doubleInPlace` **using an ampersand, `&`**, before its name, which is an **explicit recognition that you’re aware it is being used as `inout`.**

  ```swift
  var myNum = 10
  doubleInPlace(number: &myNum) // 20
  ```





### 10-2. When should you use inout parameters?

- The most commonly used inouts

  - `+=`, `-=`

    ```swift
    // example
    func +=(leftNumber: inout Int, rightNumber: Int) {
        // code here
    }
    ```

- It’s best to **avoid** creating `inout` parameters until you feel confident they are definitely the right choice. When you’re learning (and actually when you’re very experienced too!) it’s usually better to send in some data to a function and get new data back, because it makes it easier to follow your program’s logic.
