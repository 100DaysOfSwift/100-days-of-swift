# üéØ Day11: Protocols and extensions

## 1. [Protocols](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/9/1/protocols)

### 1-1. Protocols

- Protocols are a way of describing what **properties and methods** something must have. You then tell Swift which types use that protocol ‚Äì a process known as adopting or conforming to a protocol.
  - We can‚Äôt *create* instances of that protocol - it‚Äôs a **description of what we want**, rather than something we can create and use directly.


```swift
protocol Identifiable {
  var id: String {get set}
}
```

- But we *can* create a **struct** that conforms to it:

```swift
struct User: Identifiable {
    var id: String
}
```

```swift
func displayID(thing: Identifiable) {
    print("My ID is \(thing.id)")
}
```



### 1-2. Why does Swift need protocols?

- Protocols let us create **blueprints** of how our types share functionality, then use those blueprints in our functions to let them work on a wider variety of data.






## 2. [Protocol inheritance](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/9/2/protocol-inheritance)

### 2-1. Protocol inheritance

- ÌîÑÎ°úÌÜ†ÏΩú ÏÉÅÏÜç
- Unlike with classes, you **can inherit from multiple protocols** at the same time.

```swift
protocol Payable {
    func calculateWages() -> Int
}

protocol NeedsTraining {
    func study()
}

protocol HasVacation {
    func takeVacation(days: Int)
}
```

- We can create a single `Employee` protocol that brings them together in one protocol.

```swift
protocol Employee: Payable, NeedsTraining, HasVacation { }
```



### 2-2. When should we use protocol inheritance?

- One common reason for using protocol inheritance is to **combine functionality for common work**. For example:
  - Using protocol inheritance in this way lets us **share definitions and reduce duplication**, which is a great way to build up functionality piece by piece.

- The second common reason for using protocol inheritance is to **add extra restrictions** when they make sense.

## 3. [Extensions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/9/3/extensions)

### 3-1. Extensions

- Extensions allow you to add methods to existing types, to make them do things they weren‚Äôt originally designed to do.

```swift
extension Int {
    func squared() -> Int {
        return self * self
    }
}

let number = 8
number.squared()
```

- Swift doesn‚Äôt let you add stored properties in extensions, so you must use computed properties instead.

```swift
extension Int {
    var isEven: Bool {
        return self % 2 == 0
    }
}

let number = 7
number.isEven // false
```



### 3-2. When should you use extensions in Swift?

- 






## 4. [Protocol extensions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/9/4/protocol-extensions)

### 4-1. Protocol extensions

- Protocol extensions are like regular extensions, except rather than extending a specific type like `Int` you **extend a whole protocol** so that all conforming types get your changes.
  - Extensions let you provide the code inside your methods, but only affect one data type ‚Äì you can‚Äôt add the method to lots of types at the same time. 
  

```swift
let pythons = ["Eric", "Graham", "John", "Michael", "Terry", "Terry"]
let beatles = Set(["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"])
```

```swift
extension Collection {
    func summarize() {
        print("There are \(count) of us:")

        for name in self {
            print(name)
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
pythons.summarize()
beatles.summarize()
```

## 5. [Protocol-oriented programming](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/9/5/protocol-oriented-programming)

### 5-1. Protocol-oriented programming

- ‚Äúprotocol-oriented programming‚Äù ‚Äì crafting your code around protocols and protocol extensions.

```swift
protocol Identifiable {
    var id: String { get set }
    func identify()
}
```

We *could* make every conforming type write their own `identify()` method, but **protocol extensions allow us to provide a default**:

```swift
extension Identifiable {
    func identify() {
        print("My ID is \(id).")
    }
}
```

```swift
struct User: Identifiable {
  var id: String
}

let twostraws = User(id: "twostraws")
twostraws.identify() // My ID is twostraws
```



### 5-2. How is protocol-oriented programming different from object-oriented programming?
