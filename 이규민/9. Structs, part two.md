# ðŸŽ¯ Day9: Structs, part two

## 1. [Initializers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/8/initializers)

### 1-1. Initializers

- ì´ˆê¸°í™”
- All structs come with one initializer by default, called their *memberwise initializer* â€“ this asks you to provide a value for each property when you create the struct.

```swift
struct User {
    var username: String

    init() {
        username = "Anonymous"
        print("Creating a new user!")
    }
}
```

```swift
var user = User() // username "Anonymous"
user.username = "twostraws" // username "twostraws"
```

## 2. [Referring to the current instance](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/9/referring-to-the-current-instance)

### 2-1. Referring to the current instance

- Inside methods you get a special constant called `self`, which **points to whatever instance of the struct is currently being used.**
- This `self` value is particularly useful when you create initializers that have the same parameter names as your property
  - `self.name` refers to the **property**
  - `name` refers to the **parameter**


```swift
struct Person {
  var name: String // self.name
  
  init(name: String) { // name
    print("\(name) was born!")
    self.name = name
  }
}
```

```swift
var person = Person(name: "Gyumin")
```



### 2-2. When would you use self in a method?

## 3. [Lazy properties](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/10/lazy-properties)

### 3-1. Lazy properties

- As a **performance optimization**, Swift lets you create some properties only when they are needed.

```swift
struct FamilyTree {
    init() {
        print("Creating family tree!")
    }
}
```

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var familyTree = FamilyTree()
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

- But what if we **didnâ€™t always need** the family tree for a particular person? 
  - If we add the `lazy` keyword to the `familyTree` property, then Swift will only create the `FamilyTree` struct when **itâ€™s first accessed**:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    lazy var familyTree = FamilyTree() // lazy
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

```swift
ed.familyTree
```

## 4. [Static properties and methods](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/11/static-properties-and-methods)

### 4-1. Static properties and methods

- You can also ask Swift to share **specific properties and methods** across all instances of the **struct** by declaring them as `static`.

  ```swift
  struct Student {
      static var classSize = 0 // static
      var name: String
  
      init(name: String) {
          self.name = name
          Student.classSize += 1
      }
  }
  ```

  ```swift
  let ed = Student(name: "Ed")
  print(Student.classSize) // 1
  
  let taylor = Student(name: "Taylor")
  print(Student.classSize) // 2
  ```

## 5. [Access control](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/7/12/access-control)

### 5-1. Access control

- ì ‘ê·¼ì œì–´
- Access control lets you **restrict** which code can use properties and methods. 

```swift
struct Person {
    private var id: String // private

    init(id: String) {
        self.id = id
    }
}

let ed = Person(id: "12345")
```

- with `private` keyword, only methods inside `Person` can read the `id` property

```swift
struct Person {
    private var id: String

    init(id: String) {
        self.id = id
    }
}
```

```swift
struct Person {
    private var id: String

    init(id: String) {
        self.id = id
    }

    func identify() -> String {
        return "My social security number is \(id)" // only methods inside Person can access
    }
}
```
