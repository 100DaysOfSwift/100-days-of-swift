# 🎉 Day1: First Steps in Swift

## 0. Getting Started

1. Launch Xcode
2. Goto `File` > `New` > `Playground`
3. Choose `Blank`



## 1. [Variables](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/1/variables)

### 1-1. Variables

```swift
import UIKit

var greeting = "Hello, playground"
greeting = "Goodbye"

// "Hello, Playground"
// "Goodbye"
```

- Places where you can store (temporary) program data
  - you can change variables values freely



### 1-2. Why does Swift have variables?

### 1-3. Test: Variables





## 2. [Strings and integers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/2/strings-and-integers)

### 2-1. Strings and integers

- Swift is a type-safe language

  - every variable must be of one specific type

- String == `str`

  ```swift
  var greeting = "Hello, playground" // Hello, playground
  
  greeting = "Goodbye" // Goodbye
  greeting = 38 // Error
  ```

- Integer == `Int`

  ```swift
  var age = 38
  ```

- large numbers

  ```swift
  var population = 8_000_000
  ```

  - use `_` as thousands separators
  - cause it's easier to read .. 
  - still `Int`

### 2-2. Why is Swift a type-safe language?

### 2-3. Test: Strings and integers



## 3. [Multi-line Strings](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/3/multi-line-strings)

### 3-1. Multi-line Strings

- To use line breaks

  ```swift
  var str1 = """ // must be on their on line like this
  This goes
  over multiple
  lines
  """  // must be on their on line like this
  
  // "This goes\nover multiple\nlines"
  ```

- To use line breaks only to format your code neatly

  ```swift
  var str2 = """
  This goes \
  over multiple \
  lines only \
  on my IDE
  """
  ```





## 4. Doubles and booleans

### 4-1. Doubles and booleans

- Doubles

  ```swift
  var pi = 3.141592654
  ```

  - short for "double-precision floating-point number"
  - 배정밀도 부동 소수점 숫자...,.뭐지 한국어가 맞나?
  - different from `integers`

- Booleans

  ```swift
  var awesome = true
  ```

  - `true` or `false`



## 5. String interpolation

### 5-1. String interpolation

- 문자열 보간

  ```swift
  var score = 85
  var str = "Your score was \(score)" // "Your test score is 85"
  var results = "The test results are here: \(str)" 
  // "Your results are here: Your test score is 85"
  ```

  - To place variables inside your strings
  - AND you can also **run code** inside your strings



## 6. Constants

### 6-1. constants

- Values that can be set once and never again

- `let`

  ```swift
  let taylor = "swift"
  let taylor = "lautner" //Invalid redeclaration of 'taylor'
  ```

  

## 7. Type annotions

### 7-1. Type annotations

- Type inference(타입 추론)

  - Swift is inferring the type of something based on how you created it

- Type annotions

  ```swift
  let album: String = "Reputation"
  let year: Int = 1993
  let height: Double = 5.2
  let taylorRocks: Bool = true
  ```

  - If you want to be explicit about the type of your data rather than relying on Swift's type inference by annotating types
