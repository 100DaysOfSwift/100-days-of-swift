# üéâ Day1: First Steps in Swift

## 0. Getting Started

1. Launch Xcode
2. Goto `File` > `New` > `Playground`
3. Choose `Blank`





## 1. [Variables](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/1/variables)

### 1-1. Variables

```swift
import UIKit

var greeting = "Hello, playground"
greeting = "Goodbye"

// "Hello, Playground"
// "Goodbye"
```

- Places where you can store (temporary) program data
  - you can change variables values freely



### 1-2. Why does Swift have variables?

- Variables allow us to store temporary information in our program
- If you use `var` every time you set a variable with the same name, Swift will flag this as an **error**
- Swift **wants you to be clear** whether
  - You are trying to modify an existing variable or
  - You are trying to create a new variable 





## 2. [Strings and integers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/2/strings-and-integers)

### 2-1. Strings and integers

- Swift is a type-safe language

  - every variable must be of one specific type

- String == `str`

  ```swift
  var greeting = "Hello, playground" // Hello, playground
  
  greeting = "Goodbye" // Goodbye
  greeting = 38 // Error
  ```

- Integer == `Int`

  ```swift
  var age = 38
  ```

- large numbers

  ```swift
  var population = 8_000_000
  ```

  - use `_` as thousands separators
  - cause it's easier to read .. 
  - still `Int`

### 2-2. Why is Swift a type-safe language?

- Swift will make sure we don‚Äôt make mistakes with our data. 
- As your programs grow in **size and complexity**, it becomes impossible to keep the types of your variables





## 3. [Multi-line Strings](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/3/multi-line-strings)

### 3-1. Multi-line Strings

- To use line breaks

  ```swift
  var str1 = """ // must be on their on line like this
  This goes
  over multiple
  lines
  """  // must be on their on line like this
  
  // "This goes\nover multiple\nlines"
  ```

- To use line breaks only to format your code neatly

  ```swift
  var str2 = """
  This goes \
  over multiple \
  lines only \
  on my IDE
  """
  ```



### 3-2. Why does Swift need multi-line strings?

- Text remains easy to read in your code
- If you plan to **share your code** with others ‚Äì if they see an error message in your program they might want to search your code for it, and if you‚Äôve split it across **multiple lines** their **search might fail**.
  - Therefore try to avoid using multi-line strings when you need to share your code with others





## 4. [Doubles and booleans](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/4/doubles-and-booleans)

### 4-1. Doubles and booleans

- Doubles

  ```swift
  var pi = 3.141592654
  ```

  - short for "double-precision floating-point number"
  - Î∞∞Ï†ïÎ∞ÄÎèÑ Î∂ÄÎèô ÏÜåÏàòÏ†ê Ïà´Ïûê...,.Î≠êÏßÄ ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥Í∞Ä ÎßûÎÇò?
  - different from `integers`

- Booleans

  ```swift
  var awesome = true
  ```

  - `true` or `false`



### 4-2. Why does Swift need both Doubles and Integers?

- The two main types of numbers: `integers` and `doubles`
  - If a number includes decimal point, it's considered a double

```swift
var myInt = 1
var myDouble = 1.0 
```

- We can't do `myInt + myDouble` 
  - Because Swift is playing it **safe** by not allowing them
  - `myInt + myDouble` will be 2, which is an <u>integer</u>
  - **BUT** if `myDouble = 1.1`, `myInt + myDouble` turns out to be 2.1 - which is a <u>double</u>





## 5. [String interpolation](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/5/string-interpolation)

### 5-1. String interpolation

- Î¨∏ÏûêÏó¥ Î≥¥Í∞Ñ

  ```swift
  var score = 85
  var str = "Your score was \(score)" // "Your test score is 85"
  var results = "The test results are here: \(str)" 
  // "Your results are here: Your test score is 85"
  ```

  - To place variables inside your strings
  - AND you can also **run code** inside your strings



### 5-2. Why does Swift have string interpolation?

- Swift gives us string interpolation as a way of **injecting custom data into strings** at **runtim**e: it replaces one or more parts of a string with data provided by us
- Swift is capable of placing any kind of data(string, integer, boolean, etc) inside string interpolation

- [Super-powered string interpolation in Swift 5.0](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/178/super-powered-string-interpolation-in-swift-5-0)
  - Custom interpolations 
  - `String.StringInterpolation`
  - `appendInterpolation()`





## 6. [Constants](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/6/constants)

### 6-1. constants

- Values that can be set once and never again

- `let`

  ```swift
  let taylor = "swift"
  let taylor = "lautner" //Invalid redeclaration of 'taylor'
  ```




### 6-2. Why does Swift have constants as well as variables?

- To avoide problems
  - any variable you create can be changed by you whenever you want and as often as you want, so you **lose some control**

- Solution
  - Use `let` instead of `var`





## 7. [Type annotations](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/1/7/type-annotations)

### 7-1. Type annotations

- Type inference(ÌÉÄÏûÖ Ï∂îÎ°†)

  - Swift is inferring the type of something based on how you created it

- Type annotions

  ```swift
  let album: String = "Reputation"
  let year: Int = 1993
  let height: Double = 5.2
  let taylorRocks: Bool = true
  ```

  - If you want to be explicit about the type of your data rather than relying on Swift's type inference by annotating types



### 7-2. Why does Swift have type annotations?

- **why does Swift have type annotations?**

  - Swift can‚Äôt figure out what type should be used ahead of time

  - You want Swift to use a different type from its default

    ```swift
    var percentage: Double = 99 // 99.0
    ```

  - You don‚Äôt want to assign a value just yet

    ```swift
    var name: String
    ```

    - You can then assign a string to `name` later on, but you can‚Äôt assign a different type because Swift knows it would be invalid.

- **when should I use type annotations in Swift?**

  - It depends on the personal style

  - Author prefers to use **type inference** over type annotations

    - It makes his code shorter and easier to read.

    - It allows him to change the type of something just by changing whatever is its initial value.
