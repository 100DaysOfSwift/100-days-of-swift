# 🎯 Day6: Closures, part one

## 1. [Creating basic closures](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/1/creating-basic-closures)

### 1-1. Creating basic closures

- You can create a function and assign it to a variable, call that function using that variable, and even pass that function into other functions as parameters.
- Functions used in this way are called ***closures***

```swift
let driving = {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}
```

```swift
driving()
```



### 1-2. What the heck are closures and why does Swift love them so much?

- One of the most common reasons for closures in Swift is to store functionality 
- Some examples:
  1. Running some code after a delay.
  2. Running some code after an animation has finished.
  3. Running some code when a download has finished.
  4. Running some code when a user has selected an option from your menu.

- Closures let us wrap up some functionality in a single variable, then store that somewhere. We can also return it from a function, and store the closure somewhere else.






## 2. [Accepting parameters in a closure](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/2/accepting-parameters-in-a-closure)

### 2-1. Accepting parameters in a closure

```swift
let driving = { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}

driving("london")
```

### 2-2. Why are Swift’s closure parameters inside the braces?

## 3. [Returning values from a closure](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/3/returning-values-from-a-closure)

### 3-1. Returning values from a closure

- Original

```swift
let driving = { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
// (String) -> ()
```

- Closure that returns a string 

```swift
let drivingWithReturn = { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
// (String) -> String
```

```swift
let message = drivingWithReturn("London") // "I'm going to London in my car"
print(message) // "I'm going to London in my car"
```



### 3-2. How do you return a value from a closure that takes no parameters?

- Closure that accepts one parameter and returns nothing:

  ```swift
  let payment = { (user: String) in
      print("Paying \(user)…")
  }
  // String -> ()
  ```

- Closure that accepts one parameter and returns a Boolean:

  ```swift
  let payment = { (user: String) -> Bool in
      print("Paying \(user)…")
      return true
  }
  // (String) -> Bool
  ```

- Closure that doesn't accept parameter and returns a Boolean:

  ```swift
  let payment = { () -> Bool in
      print("Paying an anonymous person…")
      return true
  }
  // () -> Bool
  ```

  



## 4. [Closures as parameters](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/4/closures-as-parameters)

### 4-1. Closures as parameters

- If we wanted to pass that closure into a function so it can be run inside that function, we would specify the parameter type as `() -> Void`. That means “accepts no parameters, and returns `Void`” – Swift’s way of saying “nothing”.

```swift
let driving = {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}

func travel(action: () -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action()
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

```swift
travel(action: driving)
```



### 4-2. Why would you want to use closures as parameters?

- 





## 5. [Trailing closure syntax](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/6/5/trailing-closure-syntax)

### 5-1. Trailing closure syntax

-  후행 클로저
-  Original

```swift
func travel(action: () -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action()
    print("I arrived!")
}
```

- Trailing closure

```swift
travel() {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}
```

```swift
travel {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}
```



### 5-2. Why does Swift have trailing closure syntax?
